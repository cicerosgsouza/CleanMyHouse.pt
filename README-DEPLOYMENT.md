# Clean My House - Deployment Guide

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Test Users No Longer Reappear
- Automatic user seeding has been completely disabled
- Users are now managed exclusively through the admin interface
- No more test users will be created on server restart

### 2. Deployment Configuration for Replit

The application now includes multiple deployment strategies:

#### Primary Deployment (Recommended)
Use the main server with production build:
```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

#### Alternative Deployment Scripts
1. `replit-deploy.js` - Dedicated Replit configuration
2. `start.js` - Robust startup script
3. `deploy-script.sh` - Shell-based deployment

### 3. Health Check Endpoints
- `/health` - Service health status
- `/` - Root endpoint (required by Replit)

## Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure your application is built:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. For Replit deployment, use:
   ```bash
   node replit-deploy.js
   ```

3. The server will start on port 5000 and respond to health checks immediately

## Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection (automatically provided by Replit)
- `PORT` - Server port (automatically set by Replit to 5000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" for deployment
